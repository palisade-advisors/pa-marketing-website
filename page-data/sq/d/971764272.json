{"data":{"contentfulOurStoryContent":{"title":"Our story","description":{"description":"Palisade Advisors was born from a simple truth: not every small business or nonprofit has access to big-firm support — but that doesn't mean they deserve anything less.\n\nWe exist to bridge that gap.\n\nWe partner with dreamers, risk-takers, and community-builders — those who are doing the hard work without the deep pockets. Our mission is to help bring your vision to life by offering high-impact consulting with a personal touch.\n\nThe name Palisade means a protective wall — a structure built to guard, support, and give space to grow. That’s exactly what we aim to be for our clients: a strategic shield while you lay your foundation and prepare to rise.\n\nWe value clarity, trust, and long-term independence. We don’t just deliver solutions — we help you build systems you can stand on long after we’ve stepped away. You’re not just a client to us. You’re someone bold enough to chase an idea, and we’re here to help you get there.\n\nWe're a small team of three partners with different perspectives, united by one goal: helping organizations thrive on their own terms. Our size gives us the agility to adapt, the range to think creatively, and the space to treat every engagement with care.\n\nWe may be niche — but we’re building something powerful, and we’re scaling with intention."},"image":{"url":"https://images.ctfassets.net/2ttndq0v0uq7/7khS44vYuvUMTKolUq8pvh/dbd44cfbfc94e6c9994e94ea45b17e13/B6.png"}}}}
